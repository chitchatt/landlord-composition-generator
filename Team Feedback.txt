* Why is the back button there?
* No kind of catch all option
* Issue #1 is something I had already entered
* "When did you notice the issue?" looks like label
* "What does the plus button do at the top?"
* "Issue #1" - is that an automatically generated title?
* Lots of flow issues and clicking on buttons that didn't work
* Does it just send from the app?
